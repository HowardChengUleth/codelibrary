Fingerless Gloves for Hugh!

 - Maximum matching (http://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Thread&threadID=601071&start=0&mc=3#921372)

MOST LIKELY WANT:
 - Area of Intersection of Circles
 - Area of Union of Polygons

MAYBE WANT:
 - Centroid of a Simple Polygon
 - Voronoi
 - MST in Digraph
 - Circle Described by X lines and Y points
 - (Un)ranking of K-perm/comb out of N
 - Vertex Cover, edge cover, disjoint set
 - IDA* search?
 - kd-tree?
 - lowest common ancestor (Tarjan's offline algorithm, Wikipedia)?
 - Rotating calipers (Chinese library)

I SEE THIS IN A LIBRARY AND DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS...
 - Rectangle in Rectangle Test
 - Polygon Midpoints -> vertices
 - Minimum Weighted Steiner Tree
 - Golden Section Search
 - Sweep Circle

RANDOM FORMULAS WE SHOULD KNOW:
 - Triangle stuff (incircle, etc)
 - Circle Stuff (chords, etc)
