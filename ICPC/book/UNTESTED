I have added the following code to the library:

lca.cc
simpsons_rule.cc
fenwick_tree.cc (2D)
rubik.cc (Sort of tested. Need to make sure it compiles)
tree_distance.cc

They are currently untested. Please let me know if you test them.
I am currently trying to just add code now and test later
(maybe this is a bad idea, but I'm in a coding groove)
