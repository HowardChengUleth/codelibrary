Changes since Dec 15, 1998:

cqueue:
  1. Addition to the library.  Circular queue that can be resized to grow.
     From Matthew.

linsolve:
  1. Addition to the library.  Solves systems of linear equations.

matching:
  1. Addition to the library.  Unweighted matching on bipartite graphs.
     From Matthew.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes since Feb 1998:

General:
  1. lots of changes to geometry code to make all comparisons allow for an
     error of EPSILON.  May need to choose EPSILON smartly (I have yet to
     encounter a problem in which 1E-8 doesn't work).  Only changed the
     ones that include equality and inequality (==, !=, <=, >=)
  2. stripped ending Ctrl-Z added by DOS/Windows

asc_subseq:
  1. fixed bug responsible for producing incorrect subsequences

bfs_path:
  1. added "max" for gcc to work (does VisualAge still define min/max?)
  2. fixed comment about tie-breaker: it doesn't produce the largest
     path in lexicographical order
  3. removed unused variables
  
bignum:
  1. removed unused variable

binom:
  1. removed from the library.  It doesn't always work :(

ccw:
  1. changed all absolute comparison to allow for an error of EPSILON

circle_3pts:
  1. changed comparisons to allow for an error of EPSILON

common_subseq:
  1. added "max" for gcc to work

convex_hull:
  1. changed comparisons to allow for an error of EPSILON

dist_line:
  1. added an assertion to ensure that the points actually define a valid
     line.

dow:
  1. added return type for "main"

intersect*:
  1. changed comparisons to allow for an error of EPSILON

intersect_iline:
  1. changed name of function to be intersect_iline.
  2. eliminated the variable t which does nothing.

ispow2:
  1. I hated the indentation and spacing, so I changed it

mult:
  1. added a driver "main" routine for testing
  2. changed the order of parameters to match int_mult

pointpoly:
  1. changed comparisons to allow for an error of EPSILON

polygon_inter:
  1. changed comparisons to allow for an error of EPSILON
  2. doesn't compile!  fixed undeclared variable
  3. changed malloc of "used" (allocated too much)

traverse:
  1. added min/max for gcc to work

vecsum:
  1. added comment on what the tie-breaking example does
