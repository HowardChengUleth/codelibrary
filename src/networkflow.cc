 * Network Flow
 *
 * Author: Howard Cheng
 *
 * The routine network_flow() finds the maximum flow that can be
 * pushed from the source (s) to the sink (t) in a flow network
 * (i.e. directed graph with capacities on the edges).  The maximum
 * flow is returned.  Note that the graph is modified.  If you wish to
 * recover the flow on an edge, it is in the "flow" field, as long as
 * is_real is set to true.
 *
 * Note: if you have an undirected network. simply call add_edge twice
 * with an edge in both directions (same capacity).  Note that 4 edges
 * will be added (2 real edges and 2 residual edges).  To discover the
 * actual flow between two vertices u and v, add up the flow of all
 * real edges from u to v and subtract all the flow of real edges from
 * v to u.  (In fact, for a residual edge the flow is always 0 in this
 * implementation.)
 *
 * This code can also be used for bipartite matching by setting up an
 * appropriate flow network.
 *
 * The code here assumes an adjacency list representation since most
 * problems requiring network flow have sparse graphs.
 *
 * This is the basic augmenting path algorithm and it is not the most
 * efficient.  But it should be good enough for most programming contest
 * problems.  The complexity is O(f m) where f is the size of the flow
 * and m is the number of edges.  This is good if you know that f
 * is small, but can be exponential if f is large.
